"The Advanced Parameters below control boosting behavior and need to be "
"adjusted per device depending on its cooling system. They mostly affect "
"boosting behavior, which is important for desktop use.\n"
"The exception is the Temp Target (TCTL), which controls the max "
"temperature of the CPU die. On most devices, it can safely be raised up "
"to 100C.  However, if a temperature spike makes the chip reach 105C, it "
"will enter a thermal protection mode, which is 5W, for a couple of "
"minutes.\n"
"The integration times for Slow TDP and STAPM influence how many previous "
"TDP values the CPU will average to calculate its current Slow and STAPM  "
"TDP values."
